# Thinking in Ramda

This repo was created while I followed along with the excellent tutorials on [this excellent blog](https://randycoulman.com/blog/categories/thinking-in-ramda/)

The examples from the blog have been rewritten in Typescript, and I've added comments along the way to help me understand what is going on. I've also written tests for the various functions.

## How do I use it?

First clone the repo, then install the dependencies with `npm i`, and lastly run the tests with `npm test`. There isn't much else to do with this repo.
